# 🧠 Document Analysis using LLMs and Python

This project demonstrates how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for document analysis tasks such as text extraction and summarization from PDF documents using Python.

---

## 📌 Overview

Document analysis involves extracting and interpreting information from unstructured text. While traditional methods rely on manual reading or keyword-based search, LLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5 can understand language context, summarize documents, and answer queries effectively. This project walks through:

- 📄 Extracting text from PDF files  
- ✂️ Generating document summaries using Hugging Face's `t5-small`  
- 🔍 Building a scalable pipeline for insight generation
